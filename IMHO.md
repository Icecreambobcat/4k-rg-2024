# My honest opinion on this project

- A few things I'd like to touch on:
  - Time management
  - Success
  - Enjoyment

## Time management

All things considered, this was by far pretty horrific. I'm not sure if I can even describe it in words. I'd tell you to look at the commit graph to see everything you'd ever want to know about how bad the project management for this was. That aside though, it also shows how it really could have been completed in the span of about a week rather than being dragged out like this. As much as this detracts from the project, surely it doesn't implicate on the project's merits.

## Success

For its intended purpose? Rather successful at that. It's a rhythm game after all, but I'm genuinely surprised that it even runs at this frame rate with the levels I've packaged along with it. The engine runs all imported levels just fine, although better relative pathing should have been implemented sooner or later. Notwithstanding that though, it's a minimally viable product as a proof-of-concept, with blazingly fast level parsing and vast extensibility for expansion - I could continue developing this project as much as I want.

## Enjoyment

It's one heck of a learning experience, both in time management and code structure. I wouldn't call it as much enjoyable as much as I'd call it soul-destroying and a nightmare by every metric. However, I'd still tell people to follow through on similar projects not only because they're the best way to learn in context but also because they're valid proof for ability later down the road in enterprise and professional environments when you're looking for a job. Hell to go through the first time? Yes. Worth it? Also yes.
